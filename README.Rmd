## Overview

Creating maps from OpenStreetMap data can be a complex and time-consuming process. The syntax for designing maps often lacks intuitiveness and can vary greatly, making it challenging for users to produce visually appealing, print-ready maps. Additionally, overlaying additional information layers while maintaining cartographic aesthetics requires a deep understanding of spatial data, which can detract from the storytelling aspect of map creation. `cartographr` addresses these issues by providing a lightweight and user-friendly interface between `osmdata` and `ggplot2`, streamlining the map-making process and allowing users to concentrate on the narrative conveyed by their maps. It offers a practical and adaptable solution for transforming geospatial data using simple features (`sf`) geometries into informative, high-quality visualizations, thereby improving the dissemination of spatial information. Whether you’re involved in urban planning, environmental studies, or need to create impactful public presentations, `cartographr` is designed to make your work as straightforward and effective as possible. 

## Installation

Simply install from github.

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("da-wi/cartographr")
```

## Usage

*Step 1:* Begin by determining the central point of your map using the [WGS84](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System_1984) coordinates. For our example, we’ll use Vienna’s center with a latitude of `48.210` and a longitude of `16.370`. You can easily find these coordinates online.

*Step 2:* Decide on the size of the printed map, such as A4. This will help scale the text and lines on the map proportionally, no matter the print size.

```{r eval=FALSE}
set_output_size(c(300,300))
```

*Step 3:* Use the `get_osmdata()` function to collect OpenStreetMap data. Set the width of your map area in meters using the `x_distance` parameter. If you leave out the height (`y_distance`), it will be calculated based on the width and the aspect ratio of your chosen output size.


```{r eval=FALSE}
osm <- get_osmdata(48.210, 16.370, x_distance = 1200)
```

*Step 4:* The `osm` variable now contains all the geometric shapes (like buildings, rivers, parks) that will appear on your map. Generate the map with `plot_map()` and customize its look with themes and color palettes. For instance, create an infomap of Vienna using `theme_infomap()` and choose a color scheme (see `get_palette()`).

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot_vienna <- osm |> plot_map(palette = "serene") +
  theme_infomap() +
  ggplot2::labs(title = "VIENNA")
```

*Step 5:* To view your map, simply call the print function.

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot_vienna
```

<img src='https://github.com/da-wi/cartographr/raw/develop/png/vienna.png' width='100%'>

```{r eval=FALSE, include  = FALSE}
ggsave(plot_vienna + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 60)), filename = "png/vienna.png", device = "png",width = 300,height = 300, units = "mm", dpi = 96, bg = "white" )
```

```{r echo=FALSE,include=FALSE,fig.align='center', fig.cap='',fig.dim=c(2.5,2.5), out.width='70%'}
# knitr::include_graphics('vienna.png')
```

*Step 6:* Finally, save your map as a PDF file, ready for printing.

```{r eval=FALSE}
save_map(plot = plot_vienna, filename="vienna.pdf")
```

## Exploring Palettes

```{r set environment, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
set_output_size(c(160,160))
set_attribution(FALSE)
```

We set the output size for our maps and prepare to load OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for Hamburg, Germany.

```{r load osm, eval=F}
hamburg <- get_osmdata(lat = 53.545, lon = 10.000, x_distance = 1200)
```

Here, we create a data frame `df_pal` that contains a list of palette names. We then use a row-wise operation to apply each palette to our map data (osm) and store the resulting plot object. This allows us to see how each palette affects the map’s appearance.


```{r load all palettes, eval = F}
df_pal <- tibble (palettes= c("alphabet", "arctic","autumn", "bw",
                        "evening", "gray", "iberia", "imhof","lines","midnight",
                        "minimal","metropolitan","serene","swiss","tropical"),
                  hamburg = list(hamburg)) |>
  rowwise() |>
  mutate(p = list(hamburg |> plot_map(palettes) + theme_infomap() + labs(title = palettes)))
```

## Palette overview

Finally, we extract and display all the map plots from `df_pal`.

```{r plot palettes, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE, results='hide',fig.keep='all', fig.dpi=72, fig.dim=c(6,6), out.width="100%"}
df_pal |> pull(p)
```


```{r save figures, eval = F, include = FALSE}
df_pal |> ungroup() |> mutate(i = row_number(), filename = sprintf("png/plot palettes-%d.png",i)) |> rowwise() |> mutate(res = ggsave(p + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 60)), filename = sprintf("png/plot palettes-%d.png",i), device = "png",width = 160,height = 160, units = "mm", dpi = 112))
```
